<h2>What's CiderPress?</h2>
<p>CiderPress provides the features that Apple II enthusiasts need to manage
their disk and file archives.&nbsp; Open them, view their contents, and copy
files between them.&nbsp; There are other programs that provide access to disk and
file archives, but none have as many features or support as many formats as
CiderPress.</p>
<p>CiderPress, introduced in March 2003, was developed by
<a href="https://www.fadden.com/">Andy McFadden</a> and sold as shareware through
<a href="https://www.faddensoft.com/">faddenSoft, LLC</a>.&nbsp; The program was
made free, and the source code released under the BSD license, in March 2007.&nbsp;
A &quot;refresh&quot; to modernize the code was done in January 2015.</p>
<p><b>Key features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="features.htm#shrinkit">Full support for ShrinkIt archives</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="features.htm#disks">Full support for all common disk image formats and Apple
